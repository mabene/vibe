Driver package for the Hanoi project.

This package contains the main driver classes for orchestrating puzzle solving,
algorithm comparison, and performance profiling. The driver coordinates between
solvers, manages execution, and provides interfaces for different solving modes.

Classes:
    HanoiDriver: Main orchestrator for solving Tower of Hanoi puzzles
    AlgorithmComparator: Handles comparison of different algorithms
    PerformanceProfiler: Collects and analyzes performance metrics

Functions:
    generate_puzzle_states: Generate puzzle states for testing
    validate_solution: Validate solution correctness
