"""
Iterative deepening solver for Tower of Hanoi puzzles.

This module provides an implementation of the iterative deepening search algorithm
for solving Tower of Hanoi puzzles. This algorithm combines the space efficiency of
depth-first search with the optimality guarantee of breadth-first search.
