"""
Blind search algorithms for Tower of Hanoi.

These solvers use uninformed search strategies - they only know the start state,
goal state, and legal moves. They do not use any domain-specific heuristics 
or guidance to direct the search.

This module contains both traditional uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, 
Iterative Deepening) and bidirectional search variants that search from both 
ends simultaneously.
