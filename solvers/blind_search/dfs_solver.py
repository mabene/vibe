    A solver that uses depth-first search to find solutions.
    
    This solver explores paths deeply before backtracking, making it very
    memory efficient and fast at finding *any* solution (not necessarily
    the shortest). It uses cycle detection to avoid infinite loops and
    an iterative stack-based approach to avoid Python's recursion limits.
