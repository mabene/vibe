"""
Implements the no-search solver for classical Tower of Hanoi puzzles.

This solver performs no search whatsoever - it directly computes the 
mathematically optimal solution using the well-known classical algorithm.

    """
    A solver that directly computes the optimal solution without any search.

    This solver exploits the mathematical structure of classical Tower of Hanoi
    puzzles where the branching factor is effectively 1 - at each step, there is
    exactly one optimal next move. Instead of searching through possible paths,
    it directly computes the sequence using the classical recursive formula.
    
    Characteristics:
    - No search through state space
    - No exploration of alternative paths  
    - Direct mathematical computation
    - Optimal for classical puzzles only
    - Branching factor = 1 (no decision points)
