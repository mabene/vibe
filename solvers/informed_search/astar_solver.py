    A solver that uses A* search algorithm with an admissible heuristic.
    
    This solver combines the optimality guarantees of BFS with the efficiency
    of heuristic-guided search. It uses the "blocking disks" heuristic which
    counts disks that must be moved to unblock correctly placed disks.
    
    A* guarantees finding the shortest solution while often exploring fewer
    states than pure BFS by using the heuristic to guide the search.
