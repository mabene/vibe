    """
    A solver that uses Greedy Best-First Search algorithm with the blocking disks heuristic.
    
    This solver prioritizes nodes based solely on their heuristic value (estimated distance
    to the goal), without considering the actual path cost. This makes it faster than A*
    but sacrifices optimality guarantees - it may find a solution quickly but not necessarily
    the shortest one.
    
    The algorithm uses a priority queue where nodes with lower heuristic values (closer to
    the goal) are explored first.
