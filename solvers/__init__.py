This package contains the various solver strategy implementations.

Solvers are organized by their fundamental algorithmic approach:
- blind_search: Uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.)
- informed_search: Heuristic-guided search algorithms (A*, IDA*)  
- closed_form: Closed form solution algorithms (ClosedFormSolver)
