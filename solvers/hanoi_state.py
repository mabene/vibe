class HanoiState:
    """
    Represents a single, immutable state of a Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

    This class encapsulates the configuration of disks on three pegs. The state
    is represented by a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the
    disks on a peg, ordered from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top.
    
    The class is designed to be immutable. Methods that change the state, such as
    `apply_move`, return a new `HanoiState` instance rather than modifying the
    current one. This makes it suitable for use in search algorithms that require
    tracking visited states, as instances can be safely added to sets and used
    as dictionary keys.

    Attributes:
        pegs (tuple[tuple[int, ...], ...]): The core data structure representing
            the three pegs and the disks on them.
        number_of_disks (int): The total number of disks in this puzzle state.
